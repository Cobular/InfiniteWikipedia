# Infinite Wikipedia!

A Boost for the really cool browser Arc that recreates the wikipedia experience from scratch, improving it significantly for both long wikipedia explorations and short searches!

If you’re anything like me, you love Wikipedia! I often find myself getting sucked into some rabbit hole or another and before I know it, an hour is gone!
Anyway, I’m always frustrated about how poorly tabs work for this! I find myself stuck digging through a bunch of tabs for that one cool thing I know I opened in a new tab 5 or 10 pages ago and it’s always way more work than it should be. I’ve used a Boost to re-write the wikipedia experience from the bottom up, improving both this and regular use!
Infinite Wikipedia creates an all-new way to explore Wikipedia, allowing you to open and view everything you want, all in one tab! It’s interface is designed to help you to easily figure how you got to something, see what else you you found, and allow you to easily navigate around while keeping track of your history for later! With Infinite Wikipedia, it’s so much easier to go down a tangent and come back to where you were or just finish reading that one thing before you got distracted. Plus, it looks fantastic with styles matched to your Arc theme and an overall much cleaner aesthetic!
